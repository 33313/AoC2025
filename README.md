## Advent of Code 2025
This repo contains all of my AoC 2025 solutions.

To run them, you will need Go [installed on your system](https://go.dev/doc/install)

To check if you have Go installed, run `go version` in your terminal.

To run the solutions (using day 1 as an example):
```sh
cd day_01
go run part_01/main.go
go run part_02/main.go
```

**Obviously, there are spoilers ahead.** Try to solve the puzzles on your own first!
